# This is just here because git will by default ignore an empty folder, and we
# have chosen to ignore everything within this folder, therefore this folder
# would be ignored because it is empty. This file allows something to exist 
# within this folder. 
#
# We want this folder to exist because the Eclipse Android plugin tends to 
# complain if it has to re-create the bin/ and gen/ folders instead of just
# happily re-generating them and their contents
