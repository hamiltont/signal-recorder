Google Maps gives you API for adding additional map layers. gheat-ae 
implements a map tile server for adding heatmap layer.

Full source of gheat-ae can be found at code.google.com/p/gheat-ae. 

I have removed the .svn files here, and I do not plan on incrementally
committing my changes back upstream. I would liked to have done this, but
unfortunately my request for committer status on the project has not been
answered, so I plan to work on the code base separately, and provide patch
files if they approve of my changes. Also, the difficulty of setting up a svn
project inside of a git project seemed a bit more than I wanted to manage
for right now. Perhaps someone could do this later. My version of the 
gheat-ae code started at subversion revision 5 by author kranasian.
